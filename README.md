# On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics
This is a repository containing the code for the paper "On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics".
Some of the code is forked from ["Memory-Efficient Learning of Stable Linear Dynamical Systems for Prediction and Control"](https://github.com/giorgosmamakoukas/MemoryEfficientStableLDS)
Code still under development.
