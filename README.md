# On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics
- This is a repository containing the code for the paper "On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear Dynamics".

- Some of the code is forked from ["Memory-Efficient Learning of Stable Linear Dynamical Systems for Prediction and Control"](https://github.com/giorgosmamakoukas/MemoryEfficientStableLDS)

- Code still under development.

## Code Instructions
- Please download the dataset to your local directory.
- Run ucsd.m with MATLAB. It will learn the linear dynamics of UCSD dataset with LS, SC, SOC, WLS and CG respectively. The system matrices, training time and reconstruction error will be saved to specific directories.
- Run dtdb.m with MATLAB. It will learn the linear dynamics of DTDB dataset with LS, SC, SOC, WLS and CG respectively. The system matrices, training time and reconstruction error will be saved to specific directories.
